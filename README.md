WEB PROJECT PHASE3 - CSE5335-sxr0582-3                                          

=======================================

 1. EASY PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION:
  
        => Making 100 ajax calls to fetch data from the NoSQL database was easier since its just 
            a slight modification of Project 1 and Project2.
           
        => Displaying the data at an interval of 0.5 seconds on the browser was also a simple task
           which can be done easily using setInterval.
 
 2. HARD PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION: 
        
        => Displaying only 20 records at a time by deleting the old ones was a bit tougher 
           and had to explore various ways before getting the expected result.
        
        => Animation of incoming data was also a little hard since i had to try many animations and
           initially got unexpected results which i had to modify.

 3. CONCERN ABOUT USING THESE TECHNOLOGIES PROFESSIONALLY:
 
        => Currently we use these technologies at a very basic level. If I had to work in these
           technologies in a professional environment,I feel the knowledge I have will not be 
           sufficient and have to acquire in-depth knowledge for developing a full fledged project 
           or application.
        
        => The data on which we have to work on will also be very complex and unstructured with
           many issues. So writing some code to obtain the correct result is alone not sufficient,
           but should improve myself to write an efficient and well structured code.
